John is a guitar instructor who loves to teach the guitar, He want to automate the process of sending emails to his
students, he has a portal where his students can register to different courses and learn.There is a content team for
him who shares the content with him via email. In the subject line, there is going to be a code followed by the
username (327778_tagore). Every day John has to share some pdf notes to his students via email. The problem he is
facing is for each student he needs to Edit the pdf course material add the logo and some content to the pdf, attach
this to the email and send to respective students. In the beginning, he had only 5 students which are not difficult
for him to do it manually, now he had more students every day he needs to send the emails to 100 - 150 students which
are going be an impossible task for him.

He wanted to automate the process, This is the overview what he wanted to do.
As his portal supports to download the student's list in excel sheet, he wants to parse the excel sheet and match the
subject line with the student, read the email get the attachment append the logo and text to the PDF and attach this
to email with some content and send it to respective students.

In the excel sheet of students, he had columns named as follows
Serial ID - it is a number
Course ID - it is a number
email - it is in some format which JOHN doesn't understand (need to figure it out and fetch the email from it)
encoded_code - (he got to know that this code is generated by using Serial ID and Course ID, it is generated by
adding the hexadecimal values of Serial Id and Course ID)

and the code on the email subject followed is obtained by converting the encode_code to a decimal value.
